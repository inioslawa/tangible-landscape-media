Markus,
here it is :
the attached archive contains a svg inkscape file with several layers
you can switch on/off independantly :
-"bg" : white background ;
-"logo" : grass logo, the historical version I cleaned up ;
-"logo (greyscale)" : the same in gray ;
-"GRASS GIS (modified kerning)" : the capitalized name composed in Fira Sans  Medium and Thin weights, and with optimized kerning ;
-"grass gis" : the lowercase title ;
-"Bringing..." the slogan.

Turning on/off these layers, you can output a variety of png files, the
ones I provided are ripped at 600 dpi.

Hope this is the correct answer to your need,

Bye,
Vincent.
